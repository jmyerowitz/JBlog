Welcome to my github! You'll find files here for my website and code for past and ongoing projects. 

My website is set up using the JBlog Jekyll Theme, courtesy of **[alperenkurt](http://alperenbozkurt.net/JBlog)**.

The website includes a collection of blog posts, an about me, my resume, and links to check me out at other websites!
